### EXERCISE TWO ###
### Compute the sum, difference, and product of two numbers ###
## ADDITION ##
num1 = 10
num2 = 2
result1 = num1 + num2
print(f"the sum of two numbers is: {result1}")

## difference ##
num1 = 10
num2 = 2
result2 = num1 - num2
print(f"the difference of two numbers is: {result2}")

## product ##
num1 = 10
num2 = 2
result3 = num1 * num2
print(f"the product of two numbers is: {result3}")

### Perform floor division between 25 and 4, then print the result ###

num = 36 // 5
print (f"the floor division of number is : {num} ")

### Compute the remainder when 50 is divided by 7 ###
 
modulus = 50 % 7
print(f"the  remainder of the expression is: {modulus}")

### Use exponentiation to calculate 2^5 ###

power = 2^5 
print(f"the exponantial value of number is:{power}")

### Write an expression that calculates the average of three numbers ###

num1 = 10
num2 = 20
num3 = 30

RESULT = (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3
print(f"THE AVERAGE OF NUMBERS IS: {RESULT} ")
